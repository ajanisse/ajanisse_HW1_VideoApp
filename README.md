# Video App / Roku Part 2

This is a component to the final Roku Video App.

# Prerequisites
(For PC)
Ruby and Nodejs and needed to begin this project.

# Installing
Run NPM installs through terminal / gitbash (PC)

  $ npm install socket.io

Install express-handlebars

  $ npm install express-handlebars
Ruby (PC)

 $ sudo  apt-get install ruby
 
 
# Requirements
Use Node and Express (and other modules) to create a project complete with application
routes. The routes, plus user permissions, will determine what that user sees at any given
time. There should be different assets served per user (a Kids profile serves different UI /
assets than Parents).
The app should serve up all of the audio / video associated with a default category; load
and play a default selection.
Filter through categories and display all of the selections available (load and play a default
for each); clicking on a thumbnail should load and play that video and show its details - for
example its rating, reviews / starred reviews, social media icons (non-functional for now). 

# Testing
